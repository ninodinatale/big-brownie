--- Navigates the player to the passed coordinates x,y,z WITHOUT click to move. Returns true
--- if the player reached the coordinates in consideration of the provided threshold, false
--- otherwise.
---
--- toX, toY, toZ: The coordinates the player should move to.
---
--- options [table] (optional, and all member optional)
---     threshold [number]: The threshold to reach the coordinates. A threshold needs to be provided since the
---         player cannot reach the exact coordinates and would be stuck in place turning over
---         and over again.
---     moveFrequencyDelayMs [number]: The frequency the player moves in milliseconds. This is
---         useful to make sure the player won't spam "move forward" which would look very non humanly.
---     keepMoving: [boolean]: If true, does not stop moving forward after reaching the target
---         coordinates. This is useful for navigating a route where otherwise the player
---         would stop and then start moving again in the next cycle, which looks very bot like.
---         So use this if navigating a route or similar.

--- Navigates the player to its target WITHOUT click to move. Returns true
--- if the player reached the target in consideration of the provided distance, false

--- distance [number] (optional): The distance in yards to stop before reaching the target's
---     location. This is used for ranged attack, but also useful for melee to set some buffer
---     distance. Don't set this to 0 since it can't reach exactly zero and would move
---     around like crazy.
--- moveFrequencyDelayMs [number]: The frequency the player moves in milliseconds. This is
---     useful to make sure the player won't spam "move forward" which would look very non humanly.
